## Why? &#129300;

I don't write anymore code, at least not part of my job scope at work.

While I'm still love doing it, I'd rather continue doing it as a hobbyist coder. Never in the coporate world anymore!

- No deadline &#129326; 
- No Spaghetti code &#129327; 
- No nonsense&#128162; 
- Most importantly, no more carpal tunnel and backpain! &#129301;


Mostly, what versioned here are proof of concept on things I've learned and I am interested in.

- &#9996; Strong believer of **no code is the best code!** Impossible? Less code then!
